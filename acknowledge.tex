``\textbf{Acknowledgement} - This is where you thank all those people whom you've rarely (or never) met but whose inspiration, motivation, encouragement, blessings etc. etc. have helped u to write this immensely knowledgeable report and NOT thank your friend who did most of your coding. There is some debate as to whether Abstract should come first or Acknowledgement. I don't care bcz VTU doesnt seem to care. I wrote it this way and it was accepted ... that's all that matters."
--\textbf{writes Basavraj Talwar} in his website, a jce alumni & currently in IISc, who has also written \LaTeX-vtu-template

But for preparing this template Anandmurthy Sir of EEE motivated us \& gave guidance & some suggestions from CRN

And great thanks for Memoir-Document class manual which tells almost all things, which u want while writing a report.
